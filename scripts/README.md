## How It Works

1. User runs:
```
bash scripts/install.sh
```

2. Script asks:

*Select CLI version to install:*
1) Click CLI (stable, fewer dependencies)
2) Typer CLI (modern, type-hints, rich formatting)

Enter choice [1 or 2]:

3. The script sets up the virtualenv and installs the correct requirements.txt

4. Prints the proper command for running the selected CLI
